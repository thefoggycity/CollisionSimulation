# CollisionSimulation
Physical modelling of ball collision.

## Physical modelling
A C# class of ball with a series of methods and static calculating functions is included in this project. This class is convient for further development such as games.

## GUI
A winform GUI is included for demonstrating. Utilities of System.Drawing are used for plotting.
Via the configuration dialog provided, user can change balls' and the simulating ground's setting, as well as view the balls' attributions, easily, even the simulation is running.
